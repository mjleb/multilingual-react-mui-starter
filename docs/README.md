- **Material-UI**: Modern and customizable component library.
- **Vite**: Super-fast build tool and dev server.
- **MobX**: Simple and scalable state management.
- **i18next**: Comprehensive internationalization and localization support.
- **React Router v7**: Routing solution for modern React apps.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development experience.
- **Prettier & ESLint**: Enforced coding standards and auto-formatting.
- **Husky**: Pre-commit hooks for maintaining code quality.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for writing and running tests.
- **TypeDoc**: Generates documentation from TypeScript files and JSDoc comments, with Markdown output.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mjleb/multilingual-react-mui-starter.git
   cd multilingual-react-mui-starter
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The project will be available at: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)

---

## Testing

This project uses **Jest** for unit testing:

1. Write your tests in files with the `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` extension.
2. Tests are typically located in the `__tests__` folder or alongside relevant components.
3. To run tests, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

   Jest will automatically find and run all test files.

---

## Documentation

This project uses **TypeDoc** to generate documentation from the codebase and JSDoc comments. The documentation is generated in **Markdown** format using the **typedoc-plugin-markdown** plugin.

### To generate documentation in Markdown format:

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run jsdoc:generate
   ```

2. The generated documentation will be available in the `docs` folder.

## Internationalization

This project uses **i18next** for multilingual support:

1. Translation files are located in `public/lang/`.
2. Add new language files (e.g., `en/index.json`, `fr/index.json`) to support additional languages.
3. These files can be edited even after the project is built, enabling dynamic updates to translations.
